# Predictive classification model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for IMDB movie rating.
 Using deep learning model to train over 49,000 IMDB rating dataset to categorize either the review is positive and negative.

## Description
1. The project's objective is to categorize the IMDB movies rating. 
2. The IMDB movie reviews contain enormous amount of data, which can be used to predict either the movie review is a negative or positive review. 
3. The dataset contain anomalies such as HTML tags (removed using RegEx), lowercase and uppercase, and duplicates data.
4. The method used for the deep learning model are word embedding, LSTM and Bidirectional.
5. Several method can be used to improve the model such as lemmatization, stemming, CNN, n-grams, etc.
